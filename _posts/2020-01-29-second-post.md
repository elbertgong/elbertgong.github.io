Hey there. If you're not my direct family, you probably haven't heard from me in a while. That's because the creative faucet has been turned close to shut in the past 3-4 years. Hopefully this is the start of a change.

I would like to understand, where are the world's pressing problems where I can lend a comparative advantage and make a difference? (Well, what are your strengths?) Music, that's one. Expressiveness more generally. I think I'd be a good writer for a math major, and a good coder for a musician. Well... I've written some code in the past. In classes, for sure. A lot of python there. Pytorch. I read papers on stuff like Variational Autoencoders, and implemented models. In middle school I had a good mind for geometry and logic. In my internships I wasn't given the most meaningful projects, but I dispatched efficiently with the work I was given. My favorite moments in college were TFing for CS181 (that's introductory ML) (I love explaining concepts humorously with memorable imagery), and presenting a RNN nonlinear dynamics project. And omg singing in South Africa, that was a highlight.

OK you want to make a difference-- what kind of difference? And you want to do math-- what kind of math?
