Hey there. If you are watching this site, you are probably Nathan Gong. If you're not my direct family, you probably haven't heard from me in a while. That's because the creative faucet has been turned close to shut in the past 3-4 years. Hopefully this is the start of a change.

Here's [Africa][africa]

Another night has gone. Life goes on. Another dawn is breaking.
Turn and face the sun. One by one. The world outside is waking.

What's an AMI? (Application Machine Interface) like when you create a new instance on AWS, you can tell it to pre-install the "Deep Learning AMI", and it'll pre-install TF pytorch keras etc, all in their separate jupyter envs, and cuda etc, all to save you the work of installing libraries.

I would like to understand, where are the world's pressing problems where I can lend a comparative advantage and make a difference? _Well, what are your strengths?_ Music, that's one. Expressiveness more generally. I think I'd be a good writer for a math major, and a good coder for a musician. Well... I've written some code in the past. In classes, for sure. A lot of python there. Pytorch. I read papers on stuff like Variational Autoencoders, and implemented them. In middle school I had a good mind for geometry and logic. In my internships I wasn't given the most Earth-shaking projects, but I dispatched efficiently with the work I was given (like [this](https://www.bing.com/search?q=mlb%20strikeouts%20record)). Some great college memories include TFing for Intro Machine Learning (I love explaining concepts humorously with memorable imagery), and presenting a RNN nonlinear dynamics [project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pHhemuJ0YSrCayP-MFe2DmT4TTEv0fNF6Mqz2EQc7Bg/edit?usp=sharing). And omg, singing in South Africa, that was such a highlight. I've had difficulty finding close mentors in the past 3 years, and I nostalge for the [deep mentorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHXIjzBiFFU) of my middle-school piano years. Also, college felt like too much thinking and not enough doing.

_OK you want to make a difference-- what kind of difference? And you want to do math-- what kind of math?_ (very basic questions!)
