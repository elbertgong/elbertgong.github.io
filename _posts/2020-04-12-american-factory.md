Hi, I'm Elbert, I recently finished my undergrad, and I'm working in tech.

You know what else I recently did? I ordered a 30-day Netflix trial and streamed American Factory.

I heard about it from the Oscar buzz. (buzz, buzz!) People are _seriously_ talking up this film-- especially critics. On IMDB it has a high-90s approval rating among critics. Interestingly, it only scores in the mid-70s among non-critics. Why? Possibly because of a concerted effort to tank its ratings. Why? Because the Obamas are involved. Which leads me to my next point: the Obamas are involved! Yes, the Obamas! Barack and Michelle started a new production company called "Higher Ground" (such an Obama-y name), and American Factory is their first project of choice. Their main value-add is publicity (the real project owners are director-couple Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar. But, as Barack says, "You know... I.. still got a little pull".

If you were Obama, and you had to pick one documentary, out of the thousands of sterling 2019 documentaries, to endorse, how would you pick it?

You'd know that, regardless of what you choose, it will face a reactionary backlash on many levels. It'll become irrevocably attached to you, and all your controversial connotations, in most people's minds. It'll attract far more attention than other equally good docs-- other equally impressive feats of storytelling/engineering. That's just the reality of your life-- the Affordable Care Act becomes "Obamacare". You'd probably want to find a film as uncontroversial & impervious & rock-solid as possible. A film that checks every critical box.

Fortunately, high-stakes decision making is _what you do_.

You gather a panel of renowned experts. You draft a checklist of every possible criterion you can imagine. 

Reflections from American Factory; I had an idea of what to expect going in. Themes. Class conflict. And advanced cinematography. But when you spend time in the world, that's where the growth comes from. I want to be an ethical leader. How can I have confidence in my future moral positions, in conflicts of warlike proportions? Morality is a muscle to be exercised. Consider this two hours of exercise. I also think about the Obamas; imagine their reading story after story like this, thinking when I get to the top I swear I will stay grounded. Moral fitness should be a prerequisite. Without it, you get punditry, like a basketball writer not watching basketball. Some basic things I can do: take a small salary, control the proportion of schmoozy-to-grimy environments, work hard, be authentic with my coworkers and encourage their education/growth.
