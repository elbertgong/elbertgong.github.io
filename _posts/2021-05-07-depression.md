[2021-05-07] During these past five years, I have at times felt very very sad.

Some people (doctors, my parents) would call this depression. I would also call it depression, but not the usual sort.

[2022-12-18] Depression and laziness have become unavoidable parts of my identity. They're set in stone. Like Europe after the Roman empire, I've lost my skills and abilities. I've lost the ability to do math and write, but more importantly, I've lost the discipline to work hard and the agility to solve problems quickly. I take a long time to produce so-so output. I don't feel mentally sharp. I can't get in a flow state.  
I played a lot more piano over the past year, and I put some "jams" on social media. Fine. (Don't be too happy about Instagram posts. Instagram is sick. It's people trying to show off how amazing their lives are.) I put a video on social media dancing to "high-energy laundry"-- it was not well received. (That's fine, I can keep doing it.) I've also written about the virtues of court-level tennis.  
I haven't done any vlogging or blogging-- explaining how batteries or toothbrushes work, doing a refresher video on stat 211... I'm not sure I really want to either. Part of today's challenge is figuring out how I want to spend my time now that music activities have died down. (I found those activities unfulfilling, but I had no other choices.) Volunteer work? International engineering projects? Local government? Event operations? Tech side projects? Coursera? I'm a bit overwhelmed reading the extracurricular commitments of the Harvard Crimson's 15 most interesting seniors. But I just need to do something. Something is better than nothing, and I've been stuck on nothing for so long.  
I've developed some bad habits that have caused problems with the joint on my left thumb and inside of my left index finger. This is a big problem and I really need to stop. It's almost too painful to put into writing.  
Will I ever be a good developer? [Riffusion](riffusion.com) uses React, three.js, ML packaging software, and a bunch of things I've never heard of. And it was just a hobby project. I have 2 years of frontend "experience" but I'd never be able to make a simple web frontend in a million years. And let alone the hard sciences. This depresses the hell out of me.  
"Learn MySQL" was on my AATAII list. Haha, that seems funny now.  
I looked at Masters courses and programs, but I'm no closer to finding a fruitful career path outside of Google. I don't even know whether I'll do a Masters if I get in. What's the point of falling asleep during classes (or missing them entirely) and skipping out on extracurriculars to turn in crappy psets last-minute?
