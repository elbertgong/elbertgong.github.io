### Same old, same old sulking
Looked through old high school chem notes. Wow, I did so much math/science that I no longer have the slightest recollection of. I also read some old https://workingusername.wordpress.com posts.
Since 2017 I have been losing giant swaths of my life to listlessness and depression. Iâ€™m trying to put myself in that 2017 mindset. What were my long-term goals then? What dropped efforts can I pick back up now? The obvious answer is effective altruism. My career- and academic-related goals, like thesis/PhD, have drifted out of reach. And it is too early to think about that anyway. Let's do the small manageable tasks on my Reminder list before sharpening my long-term goals. 
But broadly put, I want to procrastinate less, make connections, and invest deeply into projects. I do not want to become obsessed with fame or exclusivity! (WHO Cares if I am better at piano than 95 or 99 percent of society?) I want to reduce human suffering. I'd like to apply mathematics (or at least immerse myself in interesting science).

### Distance between me and the pros
Top players have 10k ATP points. There is grand slam, 1000, 500, 250, Challenger 125/90/80/70..., Futures 25k/15k (which give like 20 points for a win). Roughly 1500 players have an ATP point. The lowest professional rung is around a UTR 12, or a NTRP 6.5. Male college players are around NTRP 4.5-6.5. Right now I'm about a 4.25.

What do I need to improve? Mostly just practice. Consistency and feel. Don't worry about being short or weak. Just handle heavier pace, develop resilience especially on the backhand, and on the return. Be able to deliver a deep rally ball from 5ft behind the baseline. And step in with vigor to finish points.
And adding some strength & stamina wouldn't hurt.

### Scouting McDonald vs Gasquet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA3An1xHsdI

he can't attack off the high backhand
fh return scoop vs wind-up

- step into the high backhand
- fh return scoop vs chop vs windup
- step-around fh and slingshot
- de minaur bh pickup vs kerber crouch
- backhand pass: which foot do I lead with? do i jump like kyrgios to create lift? do i slide like tsonga and deliver a flat pock? do i waft a more defensive shot like wilander? slice and try to keep it low?

### Building the ultimate tennis ML model
starting from when my opponent makes contact. given the opponent's position, my position, the ball's trajectory (speed, spin, net clearance/depth, angle... or height, spin, bounce position). I want to cluster various shot motion actions. how do i cluster these? or can i taxonomize them?

your shot mechanics affect the types of shots you can create.
mackie's bh racket head is angled high (like steve johnson but less). but this sort of thing is not very coachable in the pros..
i guess there's a difference between practicing mechanics (getting more efficient at a certain shot type) and strategy (what shot type to choose)
roughly, strategy is something I can react to in .5 sec and make a conscious decision. 

like if i was telling naomi what to work on. bh slice is too general. how about, bh slice on the run?
and how do I design the drill to replicate game conditions?

analytics to create a more entertaining sport. variety, tension. investing personally in the players

analytics to understand who's better and why. is it just spinspinspin powerpowerpower? i can't differentiate between gavrilova and s williams in one video. (unlike s williams vs azarenka 2012, clearly a cleaner hitter. when vika left a mildly deep shot, you knew serena could end the point at her will. and movement-wise she was on par with vika)


## Climate
What technologies does Bill gates think we need most?
hydrogen produced without emitting carbon, grid-scale electricity storage that can last a full season, electrofuels, advanced biofuels, zero-carbon cement, zero-carbon steel, plant and cell-based meat and dairy, zero-carbon fertilizer, next-generation nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, carbon capture (both DAC and point capture), underground electricity transmission, zero-carbon plastics, geothermal energy, pumped hydro, thermal storage, drought- and flood-tolerant food crops, zero-carbon alternatives to palm oil, coolants that don't contain F-gases  
Some of these overlap with the ones on [Project drawdown](https://drawdown.org/solutions). Is there anything I could work on?

Gordon's Citi white paper [Financing a greener planet](https://www.citivelocity.com/citigps/financing-a-greener-planet/). Saul griffith said we needed some finance folks, right? To get the interest rates right? And to drive efficient allocation. (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board)
