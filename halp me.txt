Jekyll. Karpathy's article mentions jekyll build, _posts, _assets.
Set up a Github Pages site at {my username}.github.io
installed ubuntu on windows from the msft store
Needs to "turn windows features on or off" and select "windows subsystem for linux" and reboot. Alternatively run this administrator powershell command: Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
i found my build number (16299) and other things (RAM, processor, device name/id, product id, etc) under Settings > System > About
Microsoft Docs: WSL documentation, install WSL, WSL FAQ, and more
In the Ubuntu shell, my Windows file are over in /mnt/c
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y fetched 15.2 MB of xenial updates, 60.8 MB of amd64 stuff, and unpacked/processed/set up a bunch more things.
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:brightbox/ruby-ng told me This PPA no longer includes Phusion Passenger packages, and NGINX packages with Passenger support. See https://launchpad.net/~brightbox/+archive/ubuntu/passenger-legacy
Ruby took another 200 something MB.
When I sudo gem anything, Norton throws a firewall alert: ruby2 does not have a valid digital signature, unknown unknown unproven etc. Not sure, I don't remember completely. I said "allow this instance"
I've been using Jekyll Installation Requirements and Jekyll on Windows thus far. I now have Linux, Unix, Ruby 2.3, RubyGems, GCC, and Make. I'm not gonna jekyll new my_blog right now. Gonna transition over to the Github help page Using Jekyll With Pages. (good!)
There are User/Organization and Project Github Pages. Project Pages let you build from other branches. I'll just go with standard User page for now.
Beware: I create a Gemfile with a "gem" command even though I've been "sudo gem" everything so far.
Atom is a text editor
A little scared- Github Pages told me to "bundle install", which sounds like something to install bundler and ruby. Except I already did. And I needed to sudo everything. 
And there was an error: Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension. zlib is missing; necessary for building libxml2 *** extconf.rb failed *** Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary libraries and/or headers. Check the mkmf.log file for more details. You may need configuration options.
== Attempt #2, found same problem. Error installing gdbm, error installing zlib ==
I looked online and tried sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev. nokogiri depends on libxml2 which depends on zlib. Yay! Now bundle-install works... and ooh it's installing a bunch of jekyll themes!
(Nate found the same error. Nate also had this https://askubuntu.com/questions/1054705/error-while-installing-ruby-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux)
For the bundle exec jekyll _3.3.0_ new {new jekyll site repo name}, I'm going to use 3.6.0 instead. Also, I want to create it in my existing github repo, so I use bundle exec jekyll new . --force (thanks https://michaelsoolee.com/jekyll-existing-folder/)
The line "jekyll", "3.3.0" was not there so I didn't have to delete it, and I manually added in the line gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
When I serve: Dependency Error: Yikes! It looks like you don't have jekyll-remote-theme or one of its dependencies installed. In order to use Jekyll as currently configured, you'll need to install this gem. Could not open library '{libcurl/libcurl.so/libcurl.so.4}': libcurl.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory' If you run into trouble, you can find helpful resources at https://jekyllrb.com/help/!
It seems like I don't have libcurl, libcurl.so, or libcurl.so.4. Tried "gem installing libcurl" but no luck. Somebody on stackoverflow said to "sudo gem install typhoeus", so I did. Didn't work. Somebody said "sudo apt-get install libcurl3". Seems that curl had been installed weirdly, and running this reinstalled it.
Server running. Yay!
The serve message told me that auto-regeneration may not work on some Windows versions. See https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/216. But it seems to me that auto-regeneration is enabled, and my WSL is doing well.
Now I can go to http://127.0.0.1:4000 and the site is there.
Commands I need:
cd /mnt/c/{path to place}
bundle update {github-pages}
bundle exec jekyll serve
(also, jekyll build is useful)
(also 'bundle info minima' tells you where minima gem is installed)
== 2020, back to this stage. The github pages tutorial diverges slightly from the jekyll tutorial, and I should follow the github one. I also apt-got zlib1g-dev and ruby-dev.. ==
== 2026, back to this stage. i had to update ruby to 3.x, jekyll to 4.x, remove the github-pages gem, and configure Github Actions. ChatGPT helped me. ==

Don't panic and die. Check the various troubleshoot pages.
Ohh. Jekyll is kinda like Tomcat. You build, and deploy. Lesson: yes, it's hard. But I have a lot of time to get better at things. Just gotta jump into it.

Gonna retroactively add the main links:

CHANGE THEME
You can edit the _config.yml or use Jekyll Theme Chooser under the repo > Settings > Github Pages
Also, to change theme I need to install the new gem (jekyll-themes-cayman) locally using gem install, or putting the gem into my Gemfile and using bundle install.
Ok to change the theme, I need to change layout: from home/page/post to default. 
(home/page/post make the title/subtitle look slightly nicer)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42966262/change-theme-of-my-github-pages-and-pages-are-empty/42967184#42967184
It seems like the github pages available themes don't let you have multiple posts or pages. Just one static homepage. Switching back to minima.
Using other themes besides the default:
https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/
Dark minima: using solarized-dark skin requires minima 3.0 which is incompatible with GH pages. I tried the jekyll-remote-theme songzivong/dark-minima. It didn't work for some reason. (probably me not being enough of a monkey)
keep trying to use a remote theme. Troubleshooting https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1937 etc etc. Moral of the story: it's easier to fork/copy the starter repo than copy in each relevant change. Although I understand the architecture now, it took a lot longer.
github.com/mmistakes/minimalmistakes (great!)

CUSTOMIZE HTML/CSS
github help: using jekyll with pages (customizing CSS and HTML)
base everything on the minima repo at /var/lib/gems/2.5.0/gems/minima-2.5.1
can link to html pages. add in stylesheets/scripts to those. can use wordpress to convert wysiwyg to html.
Next
- customize the minimal-mistakes. borders, font size, 
- copy the assets/css/style.scss (just includes another sass file)
- customize 404, favicon
- make a "read this first" page. turn this text file into a page. start blogging again! (about javier apfeld elegans, and everything!)

- jekyll quickstart- create a new layout with tabs (copying an old layout that probably uses "include"). non-trivial

DYNAMIC SITES
bill wurtz password kinda stuff. There are too many ways. Think CS50 finance (php javascript jquery). There's angular and react.
and.. firebase (or gcp if ambitious) backend
remember when I failed at that firebase hackathon? this could be my redeeming moment!
all the technologies from cs50.ly/beyond. heroku!

a project is starting to germinate. A "Notes" app!
