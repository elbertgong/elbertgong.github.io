I would like to understand, where are the world's pressing problems where I can lend a comparative advantage and make a difference? _Well, what are your strengths?_ Music, that's one. Expressiveness more generally. I think I'd be a good writer for a math major, and a good coder for a musician. Well... I've written some code in the past. In classes, for sure. A lot of python there. Pytorch. I read papers on stuff like Variational Autoencoders, and implemented them. In middle school I had a good mind for geometry and logic. In my internships I wasn't given the most Earth-shaking projects, but I dispatched efficiently with the work I was given (like [this](https://www.bing.com/search?q=mlb%20strikeouts%20record)). Some great college memories include TFing for Intro Machine Learning (I love explaining concepts humorously with memorable imagery), and presenting a RNN nonlinear dynamics [project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pHhemuJ0YSrCayP-MFe2DmT4TTEv0fNF6Mqz2EQc7Bg/edit?usp=sharing). And omg, singing in South Africa, that was such a highlight. I've had difficulty finding close mentors in the past 3 years, and I nostalge for the [deep mentorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHXIjzBiFFU) of my middle-school piano years. Also, college felt like too much thinking and not enough doing.

_OK you want to make a difference-- what kind of difference? And you want to do math-- what kind of math?_ (very basic questions!)
