I would like to understand, where are the world's pressing problems where I can lend a comparative advantage and make a difference? _Well, what are your strengths?_ Music, that's one. Expressiveness more generally. I think I'd be a good writer for a math major, and a good coder for a musician. Well... I've written some code in the past. In classes, for sure. A lot of python there. Pytorch. I read papers on stuff like Variational Autoencoders, and implemented them. In middle school I had a good instinct for geometry and logic. In my college internships I wasn't given the most Earth-shaking projects, but I dispatched efficiently with the work I was given (like [this](/assets/images/bing_sports_0.png)). Some great college memories include TFing for Intro Machine Learning (I like explaining concepts humorously with memorable imagery), and presenting a RNN nonlinear dynamics [project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pHhemuJ0YSrCayP-MFe2DmT4TTEv0fNF6Mqz2EQc7Bg/edit?usp=sharing). And omg, singing in South Africa, that was such a highlight. I've had difficulty finding close mentors in the past 3 years, and I nostalge for the [deep mentorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHXIjzBiFFU) of my middle-school piano years. Also, college felt like too much thinking and not enough doing.

_OK you want to make a difference-- what kind of difference? And you want to do math-- what kind of math?_ (very basic questions!)

I don't know. Modeling with diff eqs? Cloud algorithm-type stuff?

Since 2017, I have been in a depressive death spiral. It got quite bad during the pandemic. I became extremely lazy. I'm almost too afraid to try to attempt to recover. Therefore I have pretty low expectations for my next project. But my goals are
- work for a company with a strong and ethical mission
- do something that helps people-- not in the abstract
- get to know some people
